       <h1>Operators</h1>
       <hr>
       <p>
           Operators are critical in programming and as a beginner programmer it is essential that you
           have a full grasp of them. In this section we will be going through some of the basic/well-used
           operators such as Unary, Arithmetic, Rational and Logical operators. Now there is no need to worry
           that much as you will see some of these operator types are based on familiar mathematical concepts you
           have learned. But it is vitally important you know these mathematical concepts are interpreted by your IDE
           and what your output/result should look like before you compile. Let's begin, when dealing with multiple
           operators remember order of operators does play a factor.

       <br>
       <!--Unary operators-->
       <h3><ins>Unary Operators</ins></h3>
       <p><b>Increment symbolized as (++)</b>: increases the value by 1.</p>
       <ul>
           <li> a++(consider a = 10)------------> Result: a = 11;</li>
       </ul>
    
       <p><b>Decrement symbolized as (--)</b>: decreases the value by 1</p>
       <ul>
        <li> a--(consider a = 10) -------------> Result: a = 9;</li>
    </ul>
    <br>




    <!--Arithmetic oPERATORS-->
    <h3><ins>Arithmetic Operators</ins></h3>
    <p><b>Addition symbolizes as (+)</b>: Addition of two numbers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Int x = 10; Int y = 1; -----> Result: x + y = 11;</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Substraction symbolized as (-)</b>: Subtraction of two numbers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Int x = 10; Int y = 1; -----> Result: x - y = 9;</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Multiplication symbolized as (*)</b>: Multiplication of two numbers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Int x = 10; Int y = 2; -----> Result: x * y = 20;</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Division symbolized as (/)</b>: Divides two numbers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Int x = 12; Int y = 6; -----> Result: x / y = 2;</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Modulus symbolized as (%)</b>: Divides two numbers but only returns the remainder.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Int x = 12; Int y = 6; -----> Result: x % y = 0; </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <!--Rational Operators-->
    <h3><ins>Rational Operators</ins></h3>
    <p><b>Less than symbolized as (<)</b>: Operator checks if the left-side value is smaller than right side value.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Int x = 40; Int y = 10; -----> Result: x < y = False</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Less than or Equal to symbolized as (<=)</b>: Operator checks if the left-side value is smaller than or equal to right-side value.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Int x = 40; Int y = 30; -----> Result: x <= y = False</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Greather than symbolized as (>)</b>: Operator check if the left-side value is greather than right-side value.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Int x = 40; Int y = 10; -----> Result: x > y = True</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Greather than or Eqaul to symbolized as (>=)</b>: Operator checks if the left-side value is greather than or eqaul to right-side value..</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Int x = 40; Int y = 3; -----> Result: x >= y = True</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Equal to symbolized as (==)</b>: Operator checks if the value on the left-side is eqaul to value on the right-side.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Int x = 40; Int y = 30; -----> Result: x == y = False</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Not Eqaul symbolized as (!=)</b>: Operator check if the value on the left-side is <b>not</b> eqaul to value on the right-side.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Int x = 40; Int y = 30; -----> Result: x != y = True</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <!--Logical Operators-->
    <h3><ins>Logical Operators</ins></h3>
    <p><b>AND symbolized as (&&)</b>: Operator <b>checks both</b> expressions and returns True or False.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Int a = 10; Int b = 20; -----> Result: (a = 10 && b = 20) True</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>OR symbolized as (||)</b>: Operator check <b>at least one</b> expression and returns True or False.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Int a = 10; Int b = 20; -----> Result: (a = 10 || b = 20) True</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>NOT symbolized as (!)</b>: Operator <b>negates</b> expression, if expression is True it returns False and vice-versa.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Int a = 10; Int b = 20; -----> Result: !(a = 10) True</li>
    </ul>
