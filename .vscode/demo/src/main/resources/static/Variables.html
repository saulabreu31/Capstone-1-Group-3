    <h1>Variables</h1>
    <p>
        Variables are containers where the data is stored during the execution of the program. Think about variables as the space where the data would be placed during the program. At the beginning of the program this space would become available and at the end of the program this space is deleted and the values disappear. Consequently, the variables are only useful during the execution of the program and any value stored in them too. Variables would not work to move information between programs or save information after the end of the execution of the program.
    </p>
    <p>
        The variables are usually identified with a name and a datatype. While the name can be any arbitrary non system reserved word, the data type has to be assigned and cannot be changed during the execution of the program. The capacity (storage size) of the variable will entirely depend on the data type chosen for the variable.
    </p>
    <p>
        A variableâ€™s default value is 0 for numeric data types, and null for non-numeric data types. The value can be assigned and accessed at any point of the execution of the program. It is possible to reassign the value of a variable, however the value that was stored in that variable would be deleted and replaced with the new one.
