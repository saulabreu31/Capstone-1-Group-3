    <h1>Arrays</h1>
    <p>
        An array is a data structure where the information is stored in a list. The most simple way to think of an array is as a list where each element occupies a space. An array, just like a variable, needs to be a specific data type either primitive or non-primitive. As multiple values are being stored in the array, it is not possible to access all the values at the same time. In order to write or read information from the array, it has to be done one by one. To perform these types of operations, it is possible to use the ‘index’ of the element. The index is the position of the element in the array; this number starts at 0 for the first element in the array and increments with each element in the list.

        Example:
    </p>
    <code>
        &lt;datatype&gt; arrayName = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]; <br>
        // This array contains all the numbers from 1 - 8 where 1 is in index 0 and 8 in index 7 of the array.
    </code>
    <p>
        To write a specific position:
    </p>
    <code>
        arrayName[index] = value to write;
    </code>
