    <h1>What is an IDE?</h1>
    <p>An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the main tool for programming in any programming language.</p>
    <p>It is very important because code could be written anywhere from a word document to a txt file but this makes the process way easier.</p>
    <p>Program developers use it because it's a tool that has everything in one, which includes a code compiler, code editor, and a place where the code could be run.</p>
    <p>It helps with time also because by having all three tools in one location edits could be done very quickly and effectively.</p>
    <p>It could be used without an internet connection if it's on a desktop, as the desktop app could run and be edited without being connected to the internet.</p>

    <h2>So what's inside an IDE?</h2>
    <p>Mentioned previously, it has a compiler and an edit tool to use, but there are more that are very helpful.</p>
    <p>Some helpful tools included are debuggers, built-in terminal, extensions & plugins, code snippets, and navigating code.</p>
    
    <h3>Built-In Terminal</h3>
    <p>A text-based interface program used to write code within the operating system (e.g., Windows and Linux).</p>
    <p>The code could be run through its scripts and the commands embedded in the terminal being used.</p>

    <h3>Extensions & Plugins</h3>
    <p>These make the IDE more useful with what's already available to use in the IDE (e.g., Spring Boot, Gradle, Maven, etc.).</p>

    <h3>Debugger</h3>
    <p>A tool in the IDE that helps test and find bugs in the code that was being run.</p>

    <h2>More reasons that developers use IDEs:</h2>
    <p>It helps with the customization of the code and the code configuration of the language is already embedded in the IDE being used.</p>
    <p>It saves plenty of time when figuring out any issues or just plain running the code that was just written.</p>
    <p>Syntax and errors are spent heavily when coding, in which having an IDE saves time by highlighting what line the error is occurring.</p>
    
    <h2>There are different types of IDEs:</h2>
    <p>Desktop apps: These can run and be edited without being connected to the internet.</p>
    <p>Cloud-based IDEs: These run in web browsers like Chrome or Firefox through a website with a compiler.</p>
    <p>Mobile IDEs: These are not used by many but still exist in the industry.</p>
    <p>Database IDEs: These are used in MySQL and Oracle in their cloud database setups designed to be used.</p>
