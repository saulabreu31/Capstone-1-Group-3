<h1>If-Statments</h1>
<hr>
<p>
If- statements are blocks of code that perform conditional statements or in better terms decision making statments
if the statment evaluates to true. There are three main types of if-statments blocks: the <b>"if"</b> block, <b>"else-if"</b> block and
<b>"else"</b> block. With these blocks programmers can implement code to their program that can handle error made by users, different
decisions being made during the runtime of their code, and multiple actions made within the program itself unbeknownest to the user.
Let's look at some syntax of these if-statement blocks.
</p>


<!--The Syntax for If-statments-->
<h3><ins>Syntax</ins></h3>
<!--Create if block code part-->
<ul>
   <li>
       <ins><b>If- block</b></ins>
       <br>
       if () {
               <br>
             }
   </li>
</ul>
<!--Create Else if block code part-->
<ul>
    <li>
        <ins><b>Else if-block</b></ins>
        <br>
        else-if () {
                <br>
        }
    </li>
 </ul>

 <!-- Create Else- block code part-->
 <ul>
    <li>
        <ins><b>Else-block</b></ins>
        <br>
        else {
            <br>
        }
    </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
    Notice the '()' in the syntax; this is where our conditional/decision-making statements blocks. Remember that if the statement is
    evaluated to be true it will run whatever is in that block e.g., '{}'. But if the statement is evaluated to be false, it will skip over
    that block and continue on. Also notice the else-block doesn't include the conditional statement parenthesis. This is because
    the else-block is the last resort call. Used as a precation if an if-block and/or else-if block fails to excete.

 <!--Create if-block Example-->
 <ul>
    <li><ins><b>if-block</b></ins></li>
    Int age = 20;
 <!---
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if( age >= 20){
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(" You are either 20 years old or older. Congrats! ");
     <br>
   }
-->
   <pre>
       if( age >= 20){
               System.out.println(" You are either 20 years old or older!");
       }
   </pre>
</ul>
<!--Create Else-if block-->
<ul>
    <li><ins><b>Else-if block</b></ins></li>
    Int age = 20;
    <pre>
        if( age >= 20){
                System.out.println(" You are either 20 years old or older. Congrats!");
        }
        <b>else-if</b>( age < 20){
                System.out.println(" Sorry but you are younger than 20 years old.");
        }
    </pre>
 </ul>
<!--Create the else block-->
<ul>
    <li><ins><b>Else -block</b></ins></li>
    Int age = 20;
    <pre>
        if(age >= 20){
                System.out.println("You are either 20 years old or older. Congrats!");
        }
        else-if(age < 20){
                System.out.println("Sorry but you are younger than 20 years old.");
        }
        <b>else</b>{
                System.out.println("Sorry Invalid respond Try again?");
        }
    </pre>
 </ul>

<h1>Switch Statement</h1>
<hr>


<p>
   Switch statements are statements that allow a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. These
   statements are used as an alternative to if-statements but can accomplish everything that an if-statement can accomplish.
   Then why are they revelent? Well switch statements can be preferred over using an if-statment when you're having to write
   5++ if statements. When dealing with circumstances like that switch statements are the more effcient way of operating. Also
   makes your code more readable to other programmers that are reading your code as it is less cluttered. Another preference is
   checking equality of a string and/or character. Switch statements do exceed well more often when dealing with these scenarios
   compared to if-statements. Let's look at some syntax examples.
</p>


<!--Syntax for Switch Statements-->
<h3><ins><b>Syntax</b></ins></h3>
<ul>
   <li>
       <pre>
   switch() {
           case " ": ;
           break;
           default:
           }
       </pre>
   </li>
</ul>




<p>
    Notice the "()" next to 'switch' this is where your vairable you are testing for equality is placed. Within the curly brackets
    we have a case followed by quotations and semicolons and break. Within the quotations we place what we are testing our vairable too
    followed by a semicolon. It is important to note that paired quotations (" ") are used for string data types while single quaotations
    (' ') are used for the character data types. Break is used to indicate to your IDE that there is no need to look at other cases
    if there is equality between the variable and vairable tested. Oftentimes there is a default section placed to catch errors that may
    occur. For example if there is no equality found. This allows your program to handle that error gracefully intead of there being
    a code trash. Lets loop at an example.

String day = "Tuesday";

   switch(day) {
           case "Monday":
               System.out.println(" Today is a Monday! ");
               break;
          
           case "Tuesday":
               System.out.println("Today is a Tuesday! ");
               break;


           case "Wednesday":
               System.out.println("Today is a Wednesday! ");
               break;


           case "Thursday":
               System.out.println("Today is a Thursday! ");
               break;


           default:
           System.out.println("There is not day matching" + day + "sorry!" ");
        }
